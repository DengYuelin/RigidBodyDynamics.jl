<!-- # Creating a double pendulum `Mechanism`
We're going to create a simple `Mechanism` that represents a
[double pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum).
The `Mechanism` type can be thought of as an interconnection of rigid bodies and joints.

We'll start by creating a new `Mechanism`:
```@example

```



`Mechanism`s can also be loaded from an XML file called a URDF, merged, split
apart, etc. See [here](@ref mechanism_create) for more information.

# Creating a `MechanismState`
`Mechanism`s store the joint layout and inertia parameters, but no
state-dependent information. State-dependent information is instead stored in
a separate object called a `MechanismState`.
